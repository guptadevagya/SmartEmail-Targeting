## üéØ Objectives

1. **Data Integration**: Merge user demographics with browsing history to form a comprehensive dataset.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract and create meaningful features from raw data, such as user activity patterns and page visit metrics.
3. **Model Development**: Implement a logistic regression model to predict user engagement with the promotional email.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using accuracy metrics and refine it through parameter tuning.
5. **Prediction**: Generate predictions on unseen data to identify potential customers.
6. **Insights**: Interpret model results to understand the key factors influencing user engagement.

## üîß Model Implementation

### Data Preprocessing:
- **Handling missing values** and data type conversions.
- **Standardizing numerical features** using `StandardScaler`.
- **Generating polynomial features** for interaction terms with `PolynomialFeatures`.
- **Encoding categorical variables** using `OneHotEncoder`.

### Pipeline Setup:
- **Utilizing `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer`** from `scikit-learn` for streamlined preprocessing and model training.

### Logistic Regression Model:
- Configured with **L1 regularization (`penalty='l1'`)** to perform feature selection.
- Set **`class_weight='balanced'`** to handle class imbalance.
- **Solver set to 'liblinear'** for compatibility with L1 penalty.

## üöÄ Running the Code

**Dependencies**: Ensure the following libraries are installed: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`.

This command trains the model using the training data and evaluates it on the test dataset.

```bash
python3 tester.py
```

## üìä Output Files

- **`results.json`**: Contains the model's accuracy and score.

```json
{
  "accuracy": 87.90666666666667,
  "date": "04/28/2024",
  "latency": 0.3333721160888672
}
```

## üìà Results and Observations

The logistic regression model effectively predicts user engagement with the TV promotion email, achieving an accuracy exceeding 75% on the test dataset.

### Key Observations:

#### Influential Features:
- **Users with prior visits to the TV product page** are more likely to click the promotional email.
- **Higher total time spent on the website** correlates with increased engagement.
- **Recency of website visits** (e.g., `days_since_last_visit`) impacts user responsiveness.

#### Model Performance:
- **Incorporating browsing history** significantly enhances prediction accuracy compared to using demographic data alone.
- **Feature engineering**, such as capturing user activity patterns, contributes to model effectiveness.

#### Limitations:
- The model assumes consistent user behavior, which may change due to external factors like market trends or seasonal effects.
- Potential data biases, such as class imbalance, may affect prediction accuracy.
